# a spiking convolutional neural network applied to NMNIST data.
NMNIST (neuromorphic MNIST) are MNIST data converted to spike input by being recorded with a DVS sensor on a pan-tilt unit. Dataset by Garrick Orchard. [link](https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets/n-mnist)

Code is based off that from [slayerPytorch](https://github.com/bamsumit/slayerPytorch).
