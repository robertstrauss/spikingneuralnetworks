# a spiking convolutional neural network applied to NMNIST data.
MNIST is MNIST data converted to spike input by being recorded with a DVS sensor on a pan-tilt unit. (This can be found here.)[https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets/n-mnist]

Code is based off that from (slayerPytorch)[https://github.com/bamsumit/slayerPytorch].
